            I'm a fullstack developer based in
            #[a(href="") Bel√©m/PA - Brasil].
          p.
            With experience on all the (full) stack (from SASS to Docker), I prefer to work with backend and ops.
            Currently interested in: Elixir/Erlang, Ruby.
          p.
            I love open source (and is something i'm always trying to do more), you can check some half-assed projects and some useless things (or not) on my #[a(href="") github] or #[a(href="") gitlab]
          p.
            Currently working remote (yay! remote ftw) mostly with front-end (javascript, vuejs and sass) but also using phoenix/elixir and ruby on rails.
            You can check what i'm coding on #[a(href="") wakatime] (not all the work is coding tho).
          p.
            If you rather see what i have done, you can check my #[a(href="") resume].
          p.
            Something to say? #[a(href="") mailme]
        p(class="main__disclaimer") Now with the web standards &trade; like sass, pub and webpack :)
